if you know exactly what pattern you are looking for and train a computer with an artificial neural network, computers are much much faster. admittedly the human has to identify what to look for first and the pattern cannot deviate too much for a computer to identify it. but computers will have the benefit of speed

For structure like summaries and highly intepretative output, human analysis is crucial. For a rough topic model (or even better a hierarchical topic model) or term frequency / co-occurrence analysis, these are well-specified problems that computers can do efficiently and accurately. So whether humans or computers do the structure creation task really depends on the structure.
Submitted by 5 (2011-03-24 23:23:31)

Military has done a more thorough job of standardising language, because ot needs precision. Industry usually doesn't.

I guess the point here being that it may be easier to do text analysis for the military than other domains.

Basic knowledge has to be embedded in the analysis system first, so that one doesn't start producing results that are "obvious" to the analysts. For instance, a tool should not discover that army and navy use different language.

Not just trends or discovery, but also to improve communication

JDSC does decision support, not decision making. Industry use is probably similar, since big shots like to make their own decisions.

The application of text analysis to real-time facilitation. Comments?

Real-time support to the facilitator is critical, because you don't want the overall discussion divert too far away from the main topic.

Not quite sure exactly what's being asked here, but certainly it seems that real-time analysis for facilitation is important for improving and focusing the text. For example, if there is a point of high contention that is arising in the text, then the facilitator could focus the discussion and text generation on that topic.

One could develop constellations of ideas based on the text analysed then get the participants to converge on the language being used.

The main problem here is that you are talking about building an entirely new software tool and validating its UI and effectiveness... this is certainly useful, will take a great deal of effort and integration with the grouputer software.

The facilitator should be rying to get participants to amplify on issues and converrge on common word usage. Therefore there is a need to be able to view the real time use of words and query the use.

CDG has asked if we can provide a context peice that can be used to briefs a committee that frames the decison that the committee is there to address. One aspect of is is to develop a commion language and schema for individuals to interpret the purpose of the meeting.

Thousands of residents have emerged from isolation as floodwaters receded on the NSW north coast.

About 6000 residents in Yamba, Iluka and Maclean cut off by the Clarence River flooding were reached by State Emergency Services (SES) volunteers on Sunday.

The SES had been in constant contact with residents, resupplying the area with essential items by air and boat.

Just a handful of rural properties remain in isolation, SES Spokesman Dave Webber said on Monday.

On Sunday, 650 residents of Boggabilla and Toomelah, near the Queensland border. were allowed to return to their homes after the area was declared safe.

The towns were evacuated shortly before the Macintyre River peaked at 12.6 metres on Friday.

Further west, 36 residents of the village of New Angledool remain isolated with the Narran River expected to peak at 3.1 metres later in the week.

In far west NSW, about 350 residents of Goodooga and Weilmoringle are expected to be isolated for another four to eight weeks.

The SES will continue to resupply the town by helicopter and is monitoring downstream communities, including Bourke, Louth, Tilpa, Wilcannia and Menindee.

Sixty-three local government areas in NSW have been declared natural disaster zones since December as a result of flooding.

The flood-devastated Lockyer Valley is running out of drinking water as authorities continue the search for missing residents.

The death toll in Queensland from the state's worst natural disaster climbed to 13 on Thursday after the body of a man was found in a field near Grantham in the valley.

Search and rescue personnel are still carrying out sweeps of the area in the hope of finding survivors and recovering the bodies of those who were washed away when the wall of water inundated the area earlier this week.

Lockyer Valley Council CEO Ian Flint on Thursday described the region as a disaster zone.

"You've seen pictures in the past of tsunamis and cyclones, and certainly it's like all of that," Mr Flint told ABC radio.

"Houses have been washed away, infrastructure has been washed away, cars, people ... the worst possible picture that you can have is absolutely correct, particularly around the Grantham area."

Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said the devastation was of "post-war proportions", and broke down as she described the damage to Queensland communities.

Mr Flint said the primary concern in the region now is damage to the water supply.

"Our water supply has been severely damaged so we ask residents to please conserve water for absolute essentials, and we're getting tanked water, bottled water delivered this morning to alleviate the situation, but we're really facing running out of water," he said.

Authorities have advised Withcott has already run out of water, with Helidon, Gatton and Laidley also about to run dry.

They are also working to restore power and the communications network, with most lines expected to be up and running on Thursday.

Police are urging those people who have been cut off to contact them urgently once phone lines are restored.

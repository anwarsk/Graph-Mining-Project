Brazil is suffering the "worst natural disaster" it has ever seen after mudslides and flooding near Rio killed nearly 500 people, according to national media.

The news website G1, part of Brazil's biggest media group Globo, said 480 people had died in the disaster - surpassing all previous recorded death tolls from weather-related catastrophes.

It was notably worse than a 1967 mudslide disaster in a coastal town called Caraguatatuba which was "up until now seen as the biggest in Brazil", G1 said.

Estimates of the death toll in Caraguatatuba ranged from 300, given by leading daily Folha de Sao Paulo, to 436, given by G1.

Brazilian police, cited by G1, said the death toll in the Serrana region north of Rio totalled 470 by late Thursday.

The news website added 10 more deaths it said were subsequently reported by municipal officials, bringing its total to 480.

Agence France-Presse's tally has risen progressively, based on revised tolls obtained directly from municipal officials in two of the worst-hit towns, Teresopolis and Petropolis. It stood at more than 440 late Thursday - above the highest estimate for Caraguatatuba.

Destroyed roads and bridges and a damaged telephone system made independent confirmation of Brazilian media counts in several other towns and villages impossible.

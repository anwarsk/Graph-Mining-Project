Mr Swan said the government was determined to return the budget to surplus in 2013 as promised, but there would be some tough decisions ahead to achieve that.

"We're on track to come back to surplus in 2013," he said.

"We've got in place a very strict set of spending guidelines.

"There's no doubt that the costs involved in responding to this natural disaster are substantial, but we shouldn't forget that we've also got a very strong economy, a strong investment pipeline, and strong public finances."

Mr Swan said the flood disaster would affect living costs across Australia.

"There's no doubt there will be some impact, yes, in the cost of living.

"The Lockyer Valley is a food bowl which not just supplies Queensland but the rest of the country.

"There will be all sorts of impacts but ... (it's) far too early to be putting figures on those."

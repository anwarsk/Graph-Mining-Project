Blue skies brought welcome respite from the floods in NSW as evacuated residents from two of the state's worst-hit towns received the all-clear to go home.

The State Emergency Service (SES) gave families from Boggabilla and Toomelah the green light to return after the area was declared safe on Sunday afternoon.

Floodwaters there have receded, enabling people with access to transport to return under escort by NSW Police.

But amid the relief, the SES said there were still grim times ahead for other areas of NSW.

About 7000 people across the state remain cut off after storms battered the state's north and floodwaters flowed downstream from the Queensland floods.

"The SES response to flooding in NSW is now focused on resupply and forward planning for communities downstream of flood peaks on the Barwon-Darling system," an SES statement said.

"The NSW SES focus going into today is resupply of isolated communities and rural properties as well as monitoring river levels as flood peaks move downstream in the west of the state."

About 6000 of those isolated are residents of the downstream towns of Yamba, Iluka and Maclean.

The SES is sending in essential supplies, including bread and milk, by air and no properties have been seriously damaged by the flooding, SES spokesman Dave Webber said.

In NSW's far west, the 350 residents of Goodooga are isolated and expect to remain that way for another four to eight weeks.

The SES will continue to resupply the town by helicopter and is monitoring downstream communities, including Bourke, Louth, Tilpa, Wilcannia and Menindee.

Sixty-three local government areas in NSW have been declared natural disaster areas since December as a result of flooding.

Less than 500 residents remain cut off by flooding in northern NSW as water levels continue to recede.

The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) on Monday said there had been a "vast improvement" on the NSW north coast after thousands emerged from isolation.

Just 36 residents in the village of New Angledool along with about 390 in Goodooga and Weilmoringle will remain isolated in the coming days, NSW SES spokesman Phil Campbell said.

Despite cyclone swells off the coast of NSW, the Bureau of Meteorology has told emergency services that the weather should produce little trouble.

Meanwhile, homeowners have been warned of a new peril amid the clean up - scammers.

The SES has received reports of people in the central west, mid-north coast and western Sydney falsely claiming to be representing the SES in the collection of flood donations.

"The New South Wales State Emergency Service is asking people to check on the legitimacy of callers who ask for donations for flood relief," a statement said.

"The NSW SES is NOT undertaking any collection of funds for flood relief."

After about 6000 residents in Yamba, Iluka and Maclean were reached by SES volunteers on Sunday, just a handful of rural properties remain in isolation.

On Sunday, 650 residents of Boggabilla and Toomelah, near the Queensland border were allowed to return to their homes after the area was declared safe.

The towns were evacuated shortly before the Macintyre River peaked at 12.6 metres on Friday.

Further west, 36 residents of the village of New Angledool remain isolated with the Narran River expected to peak at 3.1 metres later in the week.

Sixty-three local government areas in NSW have been declared natural disaster zones since December as a result of flooding.

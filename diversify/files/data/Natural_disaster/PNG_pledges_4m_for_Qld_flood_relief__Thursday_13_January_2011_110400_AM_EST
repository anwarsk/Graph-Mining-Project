Papua New Guinea has pledged 10 million kina ($A4 million) in support for flood-ravaged Australia.

PNG, which receives close to $457 million a year from Australia in aid, has also offered military and logistical help.

PNG's Acting Prime Minister Sam Abal said he wrote to Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressing sympathy and condolences to victims of the ongoing tragedy.

Mr Abal said in a statement the donation was the least PNG could do for a neighbour and close friend who had helped PNG in numerous natural disasters.

The money would benefit those suffering severe flooding in Queensland and parts of NSW, he said.

"We are truly sorry and our hearts are with you at this time of great tragedy.

"For up to three weeks now, we in PNG have observed and learnt from the media devastating reports of the flood-induced tragedy including the bushfires our southern neighbours have being experiencing.

"Australia's steadfast generosity and charity must and should be returned whenever the need arises.

"This monetary token is our response to the need our Australian friends face," he said.

Mr Abal also said some of the money should also go to Western Australia for those who were facing bush fires.

PNG newspapers this week have raised concerns regarding numerous citizens living in flood-affected parts of Australia.

The PNG consulate in Brisbane has closed due to flooding of the Brisbane River and many worried relatives have contacted PNG media with concerns regarding their loved ones in Australia.

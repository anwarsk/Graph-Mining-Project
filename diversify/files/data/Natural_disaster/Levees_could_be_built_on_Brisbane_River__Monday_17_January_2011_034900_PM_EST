The Queensland government will consider building levees along the Brisbane River to improve the city's flood defences, Premier Anna Bligh says.

The government will also look at rezoning land with the same objective in mind, she says.

"At the end of this we want to be more resilient and better protected from these sorts of events in the future," Ms Bligh told the ABC.

"There is certainly evidence of levees protecting some of the smaller towns in Queensland during this event and we will need to consider all of these sorts of issues in the future."

She suggested some homes should not have been built where they are and that would need to be looked at.

"Clearly we have some very old homes that are in places that are clearly flood-prone," she said.

"Equally there are some places that have been approved by various authorities 30 and 40 years ago that are not so old and they're going to have big questions as well.

"We have to ask ourselves those hard questions about how to become a more resilient community in the face of these big natural disasters because we know in a tropical state we will see them again."

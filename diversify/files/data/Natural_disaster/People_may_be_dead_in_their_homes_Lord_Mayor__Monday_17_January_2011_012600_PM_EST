Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman has warned some flood victims may have died in their homes and are yet to be found.  Cr Newman called on residents, volunteers and council workers to check houses where there has been no activity for days.  He said some people may have been forgotten.  "We are concerned, sadly, about the potential for people to be found who may have died," Cr Newman said today.  "There may be people who didn't get out of their homes who have been isolated and we really need to reach out today.  "We're concerned as well that there may be elderly people or other people who have literally had a nervous breakdown.  "They may be sitting in their homes in a dark room and need help now."Brisbane facing 'homelessness crisis'Premier Anna Bligh has warned Brisbane is facing a homelessness crisis.Ms Bligh will convene a special cabinet meeting at 10am today to formulate a detailed recovery plan for the flood-devastated state.She said it was clear many people would be homeless for an extended period of time, and all options, including ‘‘work-camp’’ style hubs were being considered to accommodate them.Ms Bligh said Brisbane was facing ‘‘a massive relocation task’’ after 11,900 homes and 2500 businesses were flooded.She said many flood victims were staying with family and friends while others had insurance policies that would cover the cost of alternative accommodation.But, she warned: ‘‘There will be a very large number of people who might not have any of those options’’.‘‘We are currently looking at how we can provide temporary accommodation. It may be necessary in some places to have, effectively, a temporary work-camp set up,’’ she told the ABC.‘‘We have a large homelessness task ahead of us and we’re looking at every option.’’Major projects now in doubtSome major new infrastructure projects will have to be reconsidered in the wake of the flood disaster, Queensland Transport Minister Rachel Nolan says.Ms Nolan said projects like Brisbane’s cross-city rail project would need to be re-examined, and could be delayed given the pressure on the government to rebuild devastated infrastructure.‘‘It’s going to cost a great deal of money to rebuild from this and ... we will have to have a very comprehensive look at Queensland’s budgetary position,’’ Ms Nolan told reporters today ahead of a special cabinet meeting called by the Premier.‘‘Obviously the priority is going to be rebuilding things that have been damaged, ahead of starting on new projects.‘‘I expect that’s one of the things that will be discussed at cabinet today.’’'Biggest disaster in Australia's history'With 51 of the state’s 73 council areas affected by flooding, federal treasurer Wayne Swan says the disaster may prove the costliest to ever hit Australia.‘‘It looks like this is possibly going to be, in economic terms, the largest natural disaster in our history,’’ Mr Swan told the ABC.‘‘This is very big ... It’s not just something which is going to occupy our time for the next few months. It will be a question of years as we go through the rebuilding process ...’’Mr Swan flagged changes to the insurance industry, amid concerns over insurers refusing to compensate people who thought they were covered for flood damage.‘‘I don’t think there’s any doubt that there is a need for reform in this area. But, at the moment, we’re concentrating on dealing with the practical realities of what people are facing today,’’ he said.He also warned Australians could expect an increase in the cost of living as a result of the floods, which have hit food bowl regions, including the Lockyer Valley.City should build levees: CreanMeanwhile, building levees along the Brisbane River should be considered to prevent further disastrous flooding, federal Regional Affairs Minister Simon Crean said.Mr Crean told The Australian that some parts of the city he had visited were at very high risk of flooding because they were next to the river and at the bottom of a hill.Rebuilding in areas such as these would need to take into consideration ways of preventing future flooding, such as the construction of levee banks, he said."It seems to me we need to look at the issues for the future so we won't be faced with this again," Mr Crean told the newspaper."I don't think it's just about the planning approvals in low-lying areas -- you could have flood mitigation strategies."He also said questions needed to be asked about whether some homes along the river should be rebuilt.A minute's silence, one week onQueenslanders are being asked to observe a minute’s silence at 2.33pm today (AEST), exactly a week on from the devastating flash flooding that brought death and destruction to Toowoomba and the nearby Lockyer Valley.‘‘Wherever you are, please stop for a minute and remember those innocent people who lost their lives simply because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time,’’ Scott Buchholz, the federal MP for Wright whose electorate covers the valley, said.AAP

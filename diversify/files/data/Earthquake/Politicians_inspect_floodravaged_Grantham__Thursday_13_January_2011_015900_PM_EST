The Lockyer Valley town of Grantham has been ripped apart by the extreme flash flood that struck on Monday.

A house has been thrown into the middle of a field, and cars are wedged up trees, but the most distressing sight is a line of police officers combing the area for the dead.

Twelve people are missing from the township and 35 are missing from the valley, west of Brisbane, Inspector Mark Kelly said.

"We've grave fears for some people," he said.

"The search is a mammoth task."

One hundred and twenty Australian Defence Force personnel and 90 search and rescue volunteers have descended on the Lockyer Valley to look for life from Spring Bluff to Grantham.

"The Lockyer Creek rose three metres in 20 minutes on Monday," Lockyer Valley MP Ian Rickuss said.

"That's why we had no chance."

Deputy Opposition Leader Julie Bishop and Queensland opposition leader John-Paul Langbroek drove in to the town on Thursday,

They walked down the street, where no house had been untouched.

"These are very grim scenes ... it looks like it's been hit by a bomb," Ms Bishop said.

"The upturned cars, houses have been literally moved off their foundations."

Mr Langbroek said it looked surreal.

"I thought it looked like a scene from Universal Studios, from something like (movies) Earthquake or Volcano," he said.

"To see these houses moved off their stumps, cars on verandahs, just a scene of devastation and destruction."

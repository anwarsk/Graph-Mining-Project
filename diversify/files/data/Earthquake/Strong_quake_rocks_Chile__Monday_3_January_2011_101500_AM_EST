A strong earthquake has hit central Chile, setting off a local tsunami alert and terrifying residents still reeling from last year's massive tremor that killed hundreds of people.

Today's 7.2 magnitude quake rocked central Chile, the US Geological  Survey said. Its epicentre was in the Pacific Ocean, 96 kilometres north-west of Temuco at a depth of 32 kilometres.

There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said that, while there was no widespread tsunami threat, "earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within a hundred kilometres of the earthquake epicentre’’.

When the quake struck, people in several coastal cities quickly moved to higher ground, abandoning some shopping centres entirely.

Some mobile-phone communications were knocked out in the Araucania region.The US Geological Survey reported at least one aftershock, with a magnitude of 5.0.

Chile lies on the Pacific rim of fire and is prone to violent earthquakes. February's 8.8 magnitude earthquake triggered a huge tsunami that swept away entire villages, killed more than 520 people, and damaged hundreds of thousands of homes.

MEDICAL entrepreneur Jack Vaisman and his business partners spent $34 million advertising their controversial erectile dysfunction treatments  in 18 months, court documents show.

The company AMI, which went into voluntary administration on Wednesday, is being prosecuted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  for  unconscionable conduct, including failure to adequately inform patients what they were buying and imposing unreasonable refund conditions.

The commission is trying to ban  Mr Vaisman from  involvement in  healthcare companies for seven years and from managing any corporations for five years.

Documents tendered to the Federal Court allege  that between January  2008 and June  last year Mr Vaisman and Brian Lonergan spent $34 million advertising their products.

Last week a NSW Supreme Court judge ruled The Sydney Morning Herald could publish articles detailing AMI's alleged unethical and dangerous practices.  Mr Vaisman had tried for a year to block  publication.

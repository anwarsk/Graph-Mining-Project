THE piercing sound of a dentist's drill is enough to make most people's teeth ache. Now, researchers in Britain have invented a device to cancel out the high-pitch sound made by these mouth-sized jack hammers, which could help address some people's fear of ''the chair''.

Fear of the drill is one of the most common reasons why many people dread a visit to their  dentist, or avoid it altogether.

The new device, which works like noise-cancelling headphones, contains a microphone and computer chip which analyses incoming sound waves and inverts those waves coming from the drill, removing the unwanted noise. Electronic filters also remove unwanted sound waves, even if the amplitude and frequency of the sound waves change while the drill is in use.

As the device only cancels out the drill noise, patients can still hear the dentists and nurses talking to them. And it can be attached to an MP3 player or phone, so patients can listen to their own music while unwanted drill sounds are silenced.

One of the inventors of the device, Brian Millar, of King's College London's Dental Institute, said he was inspired by car manufacturers efforts to remove unpleasant road noises while still allowing drivers to hear important sounds.

''Many people  put off going to the dentist because of anxiety associated with the noise of the dentist's drill. But this device has the potential to make fear of the drill a thing of the past,'' Professor Millar said.

Engineers from Brunel University and London South Bank University helped build and test a prototype of the device.

''The beauty of this gadget is that it would be fairly cost-effective for dentists to buy,'' said Professor Millar.

The researchers are now looking for an investor to develop the product further.

''[That would] enable us to bring this device to as many dental surgeries as possible, and help people whose fear of visiting the dentist stops them from seeking the oral healthcare they need,'' Professor Millar said.

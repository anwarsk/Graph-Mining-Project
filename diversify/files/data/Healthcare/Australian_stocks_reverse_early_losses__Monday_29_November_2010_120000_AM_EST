The Australian share market reversed its early losses to close higher as investors bought into healthcare, energy and bank stocks.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was up 20.2 points, or 0.44 per cent, at 4,618.5 points, while the broader All Ordinaries index added 16.5 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 4,706.7 points.

"Nufarm received a broker upgrade today citing a recovery in crop protection volumes and higher crop prices," CMC Markets analyst David Taylor said.

"Analysts also like the new $1 billion debt facility."

Among the banks, Commonwealth gained 99 cents to $48.57, Westpac rose by 40 cents to $21.55, ANZ Banking Group added 26 cents to $22.78 and National Australia Bank was unaffected by its technical woes to close 30 cents higher at $23.53.

MORE Australians survive the big four cancers - breast, ovarian, colorectal and lung - than people in other wealthy countries including Britain and Denmark, research has shown.

The international study, published yesterday in The Lancet, tracked 2.4 million patients in six countries with universal access to healthcare.

It found survival rates were highest in Australia, Canada and Sweden and lowest in Britain and Denmark, with Norway in the middle.

Australian experts  welcomed the figures, which they said reflected good systems for diagnosis and treatment, but said more needed to be done.

The director of the Cancer Council Victoria, Professor David Hill, said: ''This is no reason for complacency. None of the survival rates are 100 per cent.''

Survival rates at five years for colorectal cancer in Australia were 66 per cent - 12 percentage points more than in Britain. Some 88 per cent of Australians survived breast cancer, 6 percentage points more than in Britain; and 38 per cent survived ovarian cancer, 2 points more than in Britain.

In lung cancer patients, 17 per cent of Australians survived five years, 8 percentage points more than in Britain.

Professor Hill said the study was the first  to be conducted by an international cancer benchmarking partnership aimed at establishing the differences between effective and underperforming health systems.

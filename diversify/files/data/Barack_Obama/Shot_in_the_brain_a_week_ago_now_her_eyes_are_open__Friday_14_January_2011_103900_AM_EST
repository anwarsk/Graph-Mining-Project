The US lawmaker shot in the head in Arizona has made a "major leap forward" in  her recovery, opening her eyes spontaneously and moving her legs and arms when  asked, doctors say.

Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords opened  her eyes for the first time minutes after President Barack Obama visited her on  Wednesday and is becoming increasingly aware of her surroundings and able to  respond.

"This is a major leap forward, this is a major milestone, and  we're hoping that she crosses through many more," neurosurgeon Michael Lemole  said on Thursday of Giffords, who remains in critical condition after Saturday's  shooting.

Doctors hope to get Giffords sitting up within days, they said,  adding that she has been able to keep her eyes open for up to 15 minutes, at one  point responding to the sound of the television in her room.

"Miracles  happen every day. In medicine we like to very much attribute them to either what  we do or others do around us. A lot of medicine is outside our control," he  said, when asked whether the recovery was miraculous.

"We're wise to  acknowledge miracles," he said.

Peter Rhee, head of trauma at Tucson's  University Medical Center, said he was impressed by Giffords's ability to  respond to commands when she was moved so that her legs were dangling over the  side of the bed.

"She is able to move both of those legs to command. And  that's huge," he told reporters at the latest daily update on the condition of  Giffords and others who remain in hospital following the shooting.

Six  people died, including a federal judge and a nine-year-old girl, and 14 were  wounded in the burst of violence outside a Tucson supermarket, where Giffords  was holding a public even with her constituents.

Giffords, 40, survived  despite being shot through the head from point-blank range by a bullet from the  Glock 9mm of alleged gunman Jared Loughner, a 22-year-old local  resident.

Obama visited the lawmaker in hospital on Wednesday during a  visit to Tucson to address a public memorial service for the victims of the  shooting.

US President Barack Obama has warned against reaching for simple explanations for the shooting rampage in Arizona that left six dead and 14 wounded, including a US congresswoman.

"Bad things happen, and we must guard against simple explanations in the aftermath," he said at a memorial service for the victims at the University of Arizona on Wednesday night (Thursday afternoon AEDT).

Obama called for a more civil public discourse and urged Americans not to turn on one another as he gave the eulogy.

"At a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarised - at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do - it's important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds," Obama said.

"If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate, as it should, let's make sure it's worthy of those we have lost. Let's make sure it's not on the usual plane of politics and point scoring and pettiness that drifts away with the next news cycle," he said.

Obama's remarks alluded to the angry rhetoric that has taken hold in the aftermath of Saturday's shooting.

Liberals and conservatives have quarrelled over whether violent political imagery was a contributing factor in the attack.
